        <p class="about__content__textCont__text">My Name is Rawle Night Long. I am cannibalistic nazi sympathizer that runs a dog fighting ring in the back of an Arby’s. I also DJ sometimes, but I only play Basshunter tracks. Like I swear to fucking god if you come up to me during a set and ask me to play something else I will stop the record, step out of the booth, and backhand you out of the building. </p>
        <br />
        <p class="about__content__textCont__text">I have supported Disclosure, Justin Martin, Green Velvet, Claude Von Stroke, Ronald McDonald, Kid Capri, and DJ Assault. 2017 has been a big year and 2018 is going to be an even bigger splash. Don’t look at me in the eyes. Ever. XOXO. The End. </p>
